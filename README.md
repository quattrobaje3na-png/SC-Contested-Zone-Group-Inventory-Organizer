SC Contested Zone Squad Sync: Timer & Inventory
Real-Time Tactical Synchronization for Star Citizen Squads
This is a high-performance, web-based tactical web app designed to synchronize Contested Zone timers and Shared Squad Inventory across multiple clients in real-time so everyone stays up to date. 

## OVERVIEW
In high-stakes Contested Zones, staying on the same page is the difference between a successful extract, preventing waste of time, and a total loss especially if you are operating in seperate groups.
This tool eliminates the need for constant manual callouts by providing a unified, web-based dashboard that every member of the squad can access simultaneously and quickly provide updates to the rest of the team using.
By utilizing a Public Google Sheets API as a lightweight back-end, this tool allows for zero-cost, real-time data persistence without requiring complex database infrastructure or server-side hosting.

## KEY_FEATURES
Synchronize Hangar,Vault, card, and board cycle countdowns between players via grainular reports. When one operator reports grabbing a item, or updates the timer, the information populates across all connected squad members web pages.

Track exactly which operator is carrying or has stored which key or board. Items are grouped by in-game location (Checkmate, Orbituary, Ruin Station) with specific Player Attribution Tag.

Uses Google Sheets as a "Live Database." Enter your unique Squad Code to link your session to your team’s private data stream.

## TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE
The tool operates on a decentralized frontend model:

Pure HTML5/JavaScript (No heavy frameworks for maximum compatibility).

Google Sheets for persistent state management.

AJAX/JSONP for cross-origin data fetching.

## SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS
1: Launch the tool and enter a a selected unique alphanumeric code in the SQUAD_CODE field. Ensure your entire team uses the exact same code.

2: Enter your handle in the OP_NAME field. This ensures when you move an item, the inventory correctly displays your name next to the asset.

Use the CALIBRATE or ADJ button on the timers when you aquire a item, find a used card/board printer. All squad members will see the countdown adjust immediately.
